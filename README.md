# Dataset Description

### 1. Selection of 50 MRI datasets with visible lesions.

### 2. The first 48 datasets are used for training, and the final 2 are used for testing.

### 3. Annotated datasets are sliced along the vertical axis, converting the original MRI scans and their corresponding lesion annotations into layer-by-layer images.

### 4. The converted MRI slices serve as input, and the lesion annotations serve as output to train the network. This process establishes our prostate segmentation method.
